## Deployment
Want to run a server like this? clone it! Remember centralization is bad.

### Built With.

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com) - Platform and Software Deployment
* [Go](https://go.dev) - Backend Frame-work.
* [Redis](https://redis.io/) - DataStore DataStore

### Prerequisites.

Make sure you have [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git), [make](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-Building-HOWTO-3.html) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed.

### Docker Compose

GhostBin can be easily deployed using Docker Compose. Follow these steps to deploy GhostBin:

1. **Clone Repository**: Clone the GhostBin repository to your server.

2. **Configuration**: Duplicate the `env-example` file and rename it as `.env.dev` for local development or `.env.prod` for the production environment. Customize the contents of these files according to your requirements.

3. **Build**: Build the Docker images for GhostBin using the provided Makefile command:

    ```bash
    make build
    ```

4. **Development Environment**:

    ```bash
    make up-dev
    ```

5. **Production Environment**:

    ```bash
    make up-prod
    ```

6. **Access Logs**:

    To access logs, you can use:

    ```bash
    make logs
    ```

    To tail logs in real-time:

    ```bash
    make logs-tail
    ```

7. **Additional Commands**:

    - `make down-dev` / `make down-prod`: Shutdown the development/production environment.
    - `make restart-dev` / `make restart-prod`: Restart the development/production environment.
    - `make exec-dev` / `make exec-prod`: Access the shell of the development/production container.
